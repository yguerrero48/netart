<li> I think a creative web project is a much more expansive way of sharing or presenting
  infromation and can be used in a variety of different formats and purposes.
</p>

<p>
<li>I think the internet is a great place to share any type of concept you may
have because there is always at least one person who will enjoy or understand your
creative vision. With that being said I wish to use the internet to share my interests
with those who also have similar interests.

<p>
<li> My goal in this course is to be able to learn how to put together a website
to format any creative idea in which I could express myself.
